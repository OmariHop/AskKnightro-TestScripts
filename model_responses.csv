What is the Pythagorean theorem?,2338.68 ms,"The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates to right triangles. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. 

Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

Mathematically, it is expressed as:

Where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle.
- \( c \) is the length of the hypotenuse.

This theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, although it was known to other civilizations before him. It is widely used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and various other fields.",1536.56 ms,"The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that:

**a² + b² = c²**

where:

* **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle (the legs of the triangle)
* **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

In other words, the theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).

This theorem is commonly used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides. It is also used to find the length of one of the legs, given the length of the hypotenuse and the other leg.

**In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs or cathetus).**

Mathematically, it's expressed as:

Explain Newton’s third law of motion.,2052.54 ms,"Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This principle means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction back on the first object.

In simpler terms, if you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with the same amount of force, though it remains stationary because it is balanced by the structure around it. This law highlights the mutual interactions",18015.22 ms,"Newton's third law of motion is one of the fundamental principles in classical mechanics, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton. It states:

**""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.""**

This means that when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the first object. These two forces are often referred to as action and reaction forces.

### Key Points:
1. **Equal Magnitude**: The forces exerted by two interacting objects on each other are always equal in magnitude.
2. **Opposite Direction**: The forces act in opposite directions.
3. **Simultaneous**: The action and reaction forces occur at the same time.
4. **Act on Different Objects**: The action force acts on one object, and the reaction force acts on the other object. These forces do not cancel each other out because they act on different objects.

### Examples:
1. **Walking**: When you walk, your",1639.38 ms,"Newton's third law of motion, also known as the law of reciprocal actions, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when an object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal and opposite force on the first object.

In other words, when two objects interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law applies to all interactions between objects, whether they are physical, such as collisions or friction, or non-physical, such as gravitational or electromagnetic forces.

The key points of Newton's third law are:

1. **Equal forces**: The forces exerted by the two objects on each other are equal in magnitude.
2. **Opposite directions**: The forces exerted by the two objects on each other are in opposite directions.
3. **Simultaneous forces**: The forces exerted by the two objects on each other occur simultaneously, meaning that they happen at the same",4803.44 ms,"Newton's Third Law of Motion states: **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.**

In simpler terms:

*   **When one object exerts a force on a second object (the ""action""), the second object simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object (the ""reaction"").**

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

*   **Action-Reaction Pair:** The forces always occur in pairs. There's no such thing as an isolated force.
*   **Equal in Magnitude:** The force of the action and the force of the reaction are the same size (strength).
*   **Opposite in Direction:** The forces act in exactly opposite directions.  If the action force is to the right, the reaction force is to the left.
*   **Act on Different Objects:** This is extremely important. The action and reaction forces act on *different* objects.  They *cannot* cancel each other out because they are not acting on the same object.

**Examples:**

*   **A person walking:** When you walk, you push backward on the ground (the action). The ground, in turn, pushes forward on you (the reaction). This forward force from the ground is what propels you forward.
*   **A rocket launching:** The rocket expels hot gases downward (the action). The gases, in turn, exert an equal and opposite force upward on the rocket (the reaction), propelling the rocket into space.
*   **A swimmer pushing off a wall:** The swimmer pushes against the wall (action), and the wall pushes back on the swimmer (reaction), propelling the swimmer forward.
*   **A ball hitting a wall:** The ball exerts a force on the wall (action). The wall exerts an equal and opposite force back on the ball (reaction), causing the ball to bounce.

**Common Misconceptions:**

*   **Action and reaction forces cancel each other out:** They do *not* cancel because they act on different objects.  If they acted on the same object, then the object would never accelerate.
*   **The larger object exerts the bigger force:**  The action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, regardless of the size or mass of the objects involved. The *effect* of those forces might be different due to the different masses (as explained by Newton's Second Law, F=ma), but the forces themselves are equal.

**In summary, Newton's Third Law is a fundamental principle that describes how forces always come in pairs, equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and acting on different objects.**
